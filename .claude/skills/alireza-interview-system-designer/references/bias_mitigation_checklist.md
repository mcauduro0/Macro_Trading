# Interview Bias Mitigation Checklist

This comprehensive checklist helps identify, prevent, and mitigate various forms of bias in the interview process. Use this as a systematic guide to ensure fair and equitable hiring practices.

## Pre-Interview Phase

## Bias Types to Watch For

### Affinity Bias
- **Definition**: Favoring candidates similar to yourself
- **Watch for**: Over-positive response to shared backgrounds, interests, or experiences
- **Mitigation**: Focus on job-relevant competencies, diversify interview panels

### Halo/Horn Effect
- **Definition**: One positive/negative trait influencing overall assessment
- **Watch for**: Strong performance in one area affecting scores in unrelated areas
- **Mitigation**: Score each competency independently, use structured evaluation

### Confirmation Bias
- **Definition**: Seeking information that confirms initial impressions
- **Watch for**: Asking follow-ups that lead candidate toward expected responses
- **Mitigation**: Use standardized questions, consider alternative interpretations

### Attribution Bias
- **Definition**: Attributing success/failure to different causes based on candidate demographics
- **Watch for**: Assuming women are "lucky" vs. men are "skilled" for same achievements
- **Mitigation**: Focus on candidate's role in achievements, avoid assumptions

### Cultural Bias
- **Definition**: Judging candidates based on cultural differences rather than job performance
- **Watch for**: Penalizing communication styles, work approaches, or values that differ from team norm
- **Mitigation**: Define job-relevant criteria clearly, consider diverse perspectives valuable

### Educational Bias
- **Definition**: Over-weighting prestigious educational credentials
- **Watch for**: Assuming higher capability based on school rank rather than demonstrated skills
- **Mitigation**: Focus on skills demonstration, consider alternative learning paths

### Experience Bias
- **Definition**: Requiring specific company or industry experience unnecessarily
- **Watch for**: Discounting transferable skills from different industries or company sizes
- **Mitigation**: Define core skills needed, assess adaptability and learning ability
