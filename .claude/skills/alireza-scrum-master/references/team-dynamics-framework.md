## Overview

Understanding team dynamics is crucial for Scrum Masters to effectively guide teams through their development journey. This framework combines Tuckman's stages of group development with psychological safety principles and practical scrum-specific interventions.

### Core Principles
1. **Development is Non-Linear**: Teams may cycle between stages based on changes
2. **Each Stage Has Value**: Every stage serves a purpose in team development
3. **Facilitation Must Adapt**: Leadership style should match the team's developmental stage
4. **Psychological Safety is Foundational**: Without safety, teams cannot reach high performance
5. **Measurement Enables Improvement**: Track dynamics to guide interventions

### Framework Components
- **Tuckman's Stages**: Forming → Storming → Norming → Performing → Adjourning
- **Psychological Safety**: Environment for risk-taking and learning
- **Scrum Ceremonies**: Team development accelerators when facilitated well
- **Metrics & Assessment**: Data-driven approach to team health

## Tuckman's Model Applied to Scrum

### Stage 1: Forming (Team Inception)
*"Getting to know each other and understanding the work"*

#### Characteristics in Scrum Context
- **Individual Focus**: Members work independently, unsure of roles
- **Politeness**: Conflict is avoided, everyone tries to be agreeable
- **Dependency**: Heavy reliance on Scrum Master for guidance
- **Ceremony Awkwardness**: Standups feel forced, retrospectives are superficial
- **Low Velocity**: Productivity is low as team learns to work together

#### Scrum Master Behaviors
- **Directing Style**: Provide clear structure and guidance
- **Process Champion**: Teach scrum framework and ceremonies rigorously
- **Relationship Builder**: Facilitate team bonding and trust building
- **Context Setter**: Explain the "why" behind practices and goals

#### Key Metrics & Indicators
| Metric | Forming Range | Assessment Method |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Ceremony Participation | 60-80% | Attendance tracking |
| Cross-team Collaboration | Low | Story pairing frequency |
| Velocity Predictability | High volatility (CV >40%) | Velocity coefficient of variation |
| Psychological Safety | 2.0-3.5/5.0 | Anonymous team survey |
| Conflict Frequency | Very low | Retrospective themes |

#### Intervention Strategies
- **Team Charter Creation**: Define working agreements and values together
- **Skill Inventory**: Map team capabilities and identify knowledge gaps
- **Pairing/Mobbing**: Encourage collaborative work to build relationships
- **Social Activities**: Team lunches, informal interactions
- **Process Education**: Intensive scrum training and coaching

#### Success Indicators
- Consistent ceremony attendance (>85%)
- Team members start asking questions about process
- Initial working agreements are established
- Some cross-functional collaboration begins

### Stage 2: Storming (Productive Conflict)
*"Working through differences and establishing team dynamics"*

#### Characteristics in Scrum Context
- **Conflict Emergence**: Disagreements about technical approaches, priorities
- **Role Struggles**: Tension around responsibilities and decision-making authority
- **Process Pushback**: Questioning scrum practices, suggesting changes
- **Subgroup Formation**: Cliques or mini-alliances may form
- **Velocity Fluctuations**: Performance varies as team works through conflicts

#### Scrum Master Behaviors
- **Coaching Style**: Guide conflict resolution without directing solutions
- **Neutral Facilitator**: Help team work through disagreements constructively
- **Psychological Safety Guardian**: Ensure conflicts remain productive
- **Process Flexibility**: Adapt ceremonies to team's evolving needs

#### Key Metrics & Indicators
| Metric | Storming Range | Assessment Method |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Conflict Frequency | Moderate-High | Retrospective action items |
| Ceremony Engagement | Variable (70-90%) | Participation quality scoring |
| Velocity Volatility | Moderate (CV 25-40%) | Sprint-to-sprint variation |

## Psychological Safety in Agile Teams

### Definition & Importance
Psychological safety is the belief that one can show vulnerability, ask questions, admit mistakes, and propose ideas without risk of negative consequences to self-image, status, or career.

### Google's Four Components Applied to Scrum
1. **Ability to show vulnerability and ask for help**
2. **Permission to discuss difficult topics and disagreements** 
3. **Freedom to take risks and make mistakes**
4. **Encouragement to be authentic and express oneself**

### Building Psychological Safety in Scrum Teams

#### Daily Standups
- **Model Vulnerability**: Scrum Master admits own mistakes and uncertainties
- **Normalize Help-Seeking**: "Who needs help?" vs. "Any blockers?"
- **Celebrate Learning**: Highlight lessons learned from failures
- **Time Protection**: Ensure everyone has space to speak

#### Sprint Planning
- **Estimation Comfort**: No judgment for "wrong" estimates
- **Capacity Honesty**: Safe to express realistic availability
- **Question Encouragement**: Reward curiosity and clarification requests
- **Scope Negotiation**: Team can push back on unrealistic commitments

#### Sprint Reviews
- **Failure Normalization**: Discuss what didn't work without blame
- **Stakeholder Preparation**: Coach stakeholders on constructive feedback
- **Team Support**: Unified front when facing criticism
- **Learning Focus**: Frame setbacks as learning opportunities

#### Retrospectives
- **Non-Judgmental Space**: Focus on systems, not individuals
- **Equal Participation**: Ensure all voices are heard
- **Actionable Outcomes**: Team commits to improvements together
- **Confidentiality**: What's said in retro stays in retro

### Measuring Psychological Safety

#### Edmondson's 7-Point Scale
1. If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held against you
2. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues
3. People on this team sometimes reject others for being different
4. It is safe to take a risk on this team
5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help
6. No one on this team would deliberately act to undermine my efforts
7. Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized

#### Practical Assessment Questions
- **Risk Taking**: "Do team members speak up when they disagree with leadership?"
- **Mistake Handling**: "How does the team respond when someone makes an error?"
- **Help Seeking**: "Do people admit when they don't know something?"
- **Inclusion**: "Are all team members' ideas heard and considered?"
- **Innovation**: "Does the team experiment with new approaches?"
