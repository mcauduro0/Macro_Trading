  "interpretation": {
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent commitment reliability - team consistently delivers what they commit to",
      "High ceremony engagement - team actively participates in scrum events",
      "Good story completion distribution - stories are finished rather than left partially done",
      "Low velocity volatility - predictable delivery capability"
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Scope instability - too much mid-sprint change (22.6% average)",
      "Blocker resolution time - 4.7 days average is too long",
      "Action item completion rate - only 46.7% completed",
      "High overdue rate - 53.3% of action items become overdue"
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Strengthen backlog refinement to reduce scope changes",
      "Implement faster blocker escalation process",
      "Reduce number of retrospective action items and focus on follow-through",
      "Create external dependency register to proactively manage blockers"
