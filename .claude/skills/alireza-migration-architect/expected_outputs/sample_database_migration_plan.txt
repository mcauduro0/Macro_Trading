RISK ASSESSMENT
----------------------------------------
CRITICAL SEVERITY RISKS:
  • Insufficient rollback testing
    Category: operational
    Probability: high | Impact: critical
    Mitigation: Execute full rollback procedures in staging environment
    Owner: QA Team

HIGH SEVERITY RISKS:
  • Data corruption during migration
    Category: technical
    Probability: low | Impact: critical
    Mitigation: Implement comprehensive backup and validation procedures
    Owner: DBA Team

  • Extended downtime due to migration complexity
    Category: technical
    Probability: medium | Impact: high
    Mitigation: Use blue-green deployment and phased migration approach
    Owner: DevOps Team

  • Business process disruption
    Category: business
    Probability: medium | Impact: high
    Mitigation: Communicate timeline and provide alternate workflows
    Owner: Business Owner

  • Zero-downtime requirement increases complexity
    Category: business
    Probability: high | Impact: medium

ROLLBACK STRATEGY
----------------------------------------
Rollback Triggers:
  • Critical system failure
  • Data corruption detected
  • Migration timeline exceeded by > 50%
  • Business-critical functionality unavailable
  • Security breach detected
  • Stakeholder decision to abort

Rollback Phases:
  CLEANUP:
    - Revert cleanup changes
    - Restore pre-cleanup state
    - Validate cleanup rollback success
    Estimated Time: 285 minutes

  CONTRACT:
    - Revert contract changes
    - Restore pre-contract state
    - Validate contract rollback success
    Estimated Time: 285 minutes

  MIGRATE:
    - Revert migrate changes
    - Restore pre-migrate state
    - Validate migrate rollback success
    Estimated Time: 285 minutes

  EXPAND:
    - Revert expand changes
    - Restore pre-expand state
    - Validate expand rollback success
    Estimated Time: 285 minutes

  PREPARATION:
    - Revert preparation changes
    - Restore pre-preparation state
    - Validate preparation rollback success
    Estimated Time: 285 minutes

SUCCESS CRITERIA
----------------------------------------
✓ All data successfully migrated with 100% integrity
✓ System performance meets or exceeds baseline
✓ All business processes functioning normally
✓ No critical security vulnerabilities introduced
✓ Stakeholder acceptance criteria met
✓ Documentation and runbooks updated
